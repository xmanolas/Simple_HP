Simple Human Perception Test - Student Project

This code was developed as a means for an auditory perception academic experiment. 

It is a very simple console VC++ application developed during my study years making use of midi_lib.h developed by The University of York:

https://www.york.ac.uk/media/electronic-engineering/postgraduate/reading/C-Lab-Scripts-2007-2008.pdf

Please note that midi_lib.h is not included here. 

The project was part of my contribution to Jez Wells' lectures and assessments at the Music Technology Department (University of York) in 2006.
